# Main Seller Agent â€” Smart Order Router

A TypeScript service that listens for incoming PYUSD liquidity requests and allocates INR payouts across sellers on the FX Bridge orderbook. It reserves liquidity via the hosted orderbook-service, performs (mockable) PYUSD transfers on Polygon, and triggers seller payouts via webhook.

## Features
- Prioritises Polygon PYUSD offers with configurable weights
- Greedy allocator with support for partial fills across sellers
- Reservation life-cycle using the external orderbook-service
- Mockable Polygon ERC20 transfers and UPI payouts
- Express API exposing `/health` and `/route`
- Structured logging with Pino and configurable environment

## Getting started
```bash
cd main-seller-agent
npm install
npm run dev
```

The service starts on `http://localhost:4000` by default. Configure via `.env` using the sample below.

CHAIN=polygon
RPC_URL=<polygon-rpc>
PYUSD_ADDRESS=<pyusd-token-address>
AGENT_WALLET_PK=<private-key>
CONFIRMATIONS=2
ROUTER_WEIGHTS=w_rate=0.6,w_fee=0.2,w_latency=0.2
MAX_LATENCY_MS=30000

ALLOW_NON_PYUSD=false
PAYOUT_MODE=mock
PAYOUT_WEBHOOK_URL=
```

### API

```json
